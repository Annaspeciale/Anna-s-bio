			<h3>Anna's bio</h3>
				<p>Hello, my name is Anna and I love programming. I recently started my introductory course at <strong>Epicodus</strong> and so far I've learned the basics of:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Git</li>
						<li>HTML</li>
						<li>CSS</li>
						<li>Bootstrap</li>
					</ul>
				<p>I would like to learn how to program and get a job in the booming tech industry here in Portland.</p>
				<p>I have a Bachelor's Degree in <em>Linguistics</em> from Kiev National Technical University and a Master's degree in <em>Hotel and Tourism Management</em> from Prague School of Hotel Management. I have worked in those 2 areas for the past 8 years, but I recently discovered an interest to programming 
				and would like to become a professional web developer.</p>
				<h4>Some of my favourite hobbies are:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Traveling</li>
						<li>Skiing</li>
						<li>Exploring Portland food scene</li>
						<li>Exploring Portland parks and play areas with my little daughter</li>
						<li>Spending time with my family and friends.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>I have already created a couple of projects at Epicodus and saved them on GitHub. Here they are:</p>
					<div id="projects">
						<ol>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/Annaspeciale/my-first-webpage/tree/master">My first webpage</a></li>
							<p>This project includes some basic things about me and what I like. It uses HTML and CSS.</p>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/Annaspeciale/hello-world.html">Hello in different languages</a></li>
							<p>This is a small web page with Hellos in different languages. It uses HTML and CSS.</p>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/Annaspeciale/Bootstrap-project_Wikipedia">Bootstrap project on recreating Wikipedia page</a></li>
							<p>This is where we learned the basics of Bootstrap by re-creating a Wikipedia page. It uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
						</ol>
